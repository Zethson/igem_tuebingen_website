                    <h3 class="major">Human Practices</h3>
                    <p>
                        In 2014, there were 422 Million adults with a diagnosed Diabetes Mellitus worldwide,
                        an alarmingly high number, which inspired us to look into treatment strategies of Type 2
                        Diabetes Mellitus patients, who make up the largest group of Diabetes patients.
                        There are currently many options available, however all of these treatments require
                        the patient to actively participate and comply to his or her therapy scheme.
                        As compliance and persistence are key factors for therapeutic success,
                        we, the iGEM Team Tübingen, want to revolutionize the treatment and its administration
                        by using Synthetic Biology.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Our solution is a probiotic bacterium, that synthesises a drug when it is
                        needed and therefore lifts the burden of application from the patient.
                        Thus, while checking the scientific possibilities to produce such a therapeutic probiotic,
                        we soon realized that we would have to engage the public with the goal of designing a product,
                        which meets the requirements for a successful treatment.
                        <br><br>
                        Therefore, we divided our Human Practices project into four phases:<br><br>
                        <b>Phase I: General Considerations<br>
                        Phase II: Human Practice Events of the iGEM Team Tübingen<br>
                        Phase III: Implementing new strategies based on our public integration and outreach<br>
                            Phase IV: Conclusion and Reflection</b>
                        <br><br>

                        To start with human practice work, we started with identifying all stakeholders. In our case,
                        the obvious group are <b>patients with Type II Diabetes Mellitus</b>, whom we want to help gain quality
                        of life through our project. Also, we want to make sure, whether they would be discouraged by
                        the usage of a GMO (Genetically Modified Organism).<br><br>

                        Secondly, the <b>scientific community</b>, including ourselves, are stakeholders. Since every new
                        scientific project has an impact for the whole scientific community, we have the responsibility
                        to make sure that our project will in no way compromise the reputation of the scientific
                        community.<br><br>

                        <b>Education</b>, of ourselves and others, would need to be a big factor within our project, as well.
                        Especially, the relevance and usefulness of Synthetic Biology in new therapy strategies and the
                        intensified education about Diabetes Mellitus and obesity, are important to us.<br><br>

                        Another important stakeholder to our project is the <b>civil society</b>, which will react to a new
                        therapeutic tool, especially since it is a GMO. As the potential release of a GMO is of concern
                        for all people, information must be given to the public about the safety issues a project like
                        ours might pose and how we plan on making sure, that theses issues will never become reality.<br><br>

                        Lastly, the <b>pharmaceutical industry</b> and <b>insurance companies</b> are stakeholders in our project,
                        since we are making changes to therapeutic concepts and may develop our project further into a
                        business, which would introduce new challenges like production and scale-up, corporate
                        responsibilities, economic viability and cooperation with different pharmaceutical companies.<br><br>

                        Next to the identification of the stakeholders, there are many important factors that need to be
                        taken into account during our human practice work.<br><br>

                        First of all, this includes <b>Biosafety</b>. Our probiotic will consist of a genetically modified
                        organism, which poses the risk of being released, as it would be administered orally and
                        therefore would also be excreted. That’s why we will include a so-called kill switch, which will
                        induce the killing and degradation of genetic information of our probiotic bacteria, as soon as
                        they leave the human body and the conditions, which are naturally given within the intestines.
                        Also, our team will have sufficient safety introductions, which allow us to work in the lab.<br><br>

                        On top of that, <b>regulatory and legal aspects</b> have to be considered. Hence, our work will in
                        every case be in accordance with the German Law, such as the Gentechnikgesetz (Genetic
                        Engineering Law), the Infektionsschutzgesetz (Infection Protection Law), the
                        Gentechniksicherheitsverordnung (German Statutory Regulation on the Safety of Genetic
                        Engineering) and others, which apply.<br><br>

                        Lastly, we will make sure to ethically discuss our project at any stage and consider its <b>social
                        impact</b>. As soon as GMOs are used in a way that has impact on the public, which is the case when
                        a GMO leaves its laboratory environment, a discussion must take place. In order to gain access
                        to a public dialogue, which gives us the opportunity to catch the general notion about GMOs and
                        may allow further development of our project, we will organize multiple events where open
                        science and free discussion would be welcome. Additionally, we will talk to experts and
                        different stakeholders, integrate concerns and ideas and look into strengths, weaknesses,
                        opportunities and threats.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="major">Survey about the Diabetes Mellitus Therapy</h3>
                    <p>
                        For our human practice work, we want to conduct the following survey to gather information about
                        general knowledge and options about Diabetes Mellitus, its therapy and how Synthetic Biology may
                        play a role in the future. This is very important to our project, since it will help us refine
                        our human practice work, educational approach and help us assess the perception of our therapy
                        strategy.<br><br>

                        To design our survey, we wanted to fulfill the criteria proposed by iGEM. Hence, informed
                        consent and privacy/ data protection are highly important to us. Also, our survey design aims to
                        be specific and unambiguous, with the goal of not compromising our survey by insinuating a
                        “correct” response to any question. The participation is voluntary and will be open to any
                        interested person.<br><br>
                        Once we have gathered enough informations, we will analyze and evaluate our results and hope to
                        draw conclusions for our project.
