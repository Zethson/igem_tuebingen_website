                    <h3 class="major">Our project</h3>
                    <p>
                        The aim of the project 2019 is to generate a probiotic for the therapy of Type II Diabetes
                        Mellitus based on a plasmid chassis incorporating a Cas3 self-kill mechanism to prevent
                        the spread of GMOs in the environment which also addresses the high amount of concerns associated
                        with GMOs and fulfills the necessary biosafety standards.
                        Moreover, the plasmid chassis allows for a controlled use of the probiotic and
                        limits its habitat to that of the human gut due to the incorporation of three different
                        regulators
                        inhibiting the Cas3 self-kill system when the bacterium is located in its designated
                        environment. In
                        the gut, our probiotic is supposed to form and secrete incretin mimetics in response to glucose.
                        The
                        incretin mimetics will be taken up by the enterocytes and are transported to the pancreas via
                        the blood,
                        where they enhance insulin secretion. Since Diabetes is one of the most prevalent diseases
                        nowadays, we address an important and relevant problem not only for the clinics but also for the
                        economy and world wide health situation. In addition to the development of such a GMO we also
                        plan to model
                        the efficiency, stability and kinetics of the self-kill mechanism. Using GUIDE-Seq and
                        Nextflow we will also determine the off-target cleavage of our Cas systems and plan to build a
                        GUIDE-Seq data analysis pipeline.
                        Our Cas3 biosafety probiotic chassis can also be used for different applications by exchanging
                        the
                        gene of interest within the plasmid. Therefore, our chassis can be used by researchers who
                        search for a
                        functional chassis which fulfills biosafety standards.

                    <h3 class="major">Type II Diabetes Mellitus and incretin mimetics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Type II Diabetes Mellitus is a metabolic disease that affects about 10% of the population. One
                        of its
                        major symptoms is the relative lack of insulin, which causes a decreased uptake of glucose into
                        cells,
                        leading to an energy crisis. In Type II Diabetes Mellitus the body compensates this
                        relative lack of insulin by secreting more insulin, which causes stress for insulin producing
                        beta
                        cells of the pancreas. This increased stress will, in the end, lead to the destruction of the
                        beta
                        cells, leaving the body with an absolute lack of insulin, making insulin substitution necessary.
                        In Type II Diabetes Mellitus the relative lack of insulin can have multiple reasons. It can be
                        induced by overconsumption of sugar-containing food, decreasing the sensitivity of the Insulin
                        Receptors, as they are downregulated. But it can also have genetic reasons, such as a mutation
                        in an essential gene etc.
                        A form of treatment for Type II Diabetes Mellitus are incretin mimetics. Incretin mimetics copy
                        the
                        incretin effect of incretins such as Glucagon Like Peptide 1. This is the explanation for the
                        fact that
                        oral uptake causes a bigger release of insulin, than the parenteral uptake.
                        Glucagon like peptide 1, produced in the L-cells of the intestine, is secreted upon nutrient
                        availability, and reaches the pancreas through the bloodstream. There it will bind its receptor
                        (a
                        G-protein coupled receptor), which will activate Adenylate Cyclase (if ATP is available within
                        the
                        cell), initiating the production of cAMP. Overall, this will lead to increased Calcium Ion
                        influx,
                        allowing for more Insulin to be secreted from the beta cells. This increased secretion will help
                        overcome a relative lack of insulin in Type II Diabetes Mellitus, if the amount of incretins
                        secreted
                        is sufficient.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="major">Genetically modified organisms (GMOs)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are organisms whose genetic information has been altered
                        intentionally with the use of genetic engineering. The technique used and the way of alteration
                        varies between different GMOs and comprises gene knockouts and knockins as well as enhancement
                        or
                        repression of gene expression.
                        GMOs open up many possibilities for basic research, food production, industry and
                        treatment or diagnosis of diseases. Concerns about GMOs have been raised by many people and
                        especially address their safety when intentionally or unintentionally released into the
                        environment.
                        Therefore, efforts have been made and are still made towards ensuring the biosafety of GMOs.
