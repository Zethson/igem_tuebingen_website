                        of its major symptoms is the relative lack of insulin, which causes a decreased uptake of glucose into
                        cells, leading to an energy crisis. In Type II Diabetes Mellitus the body compensates this
                        relative lack of insulin by secreting more insulin, which causes stress for insulin producing
                        beta cells of the pancreas. This increased stress will, in the end, lead to the destruction of the beta
                        cells, leaving the body with an absolute lack of insulin, making insulin substitution necessary.
                        In Type II Diabetes Mellitus the relative lack of insulin can have multiple reasons. It can be
                        induced by overconsumption of sugar-containing food, decreasing the sensitivity of the Insulin
                        Receptors, as they are downregulated. But it can also have genetic reasons, such as a mutation
                        in an essential gene etc.
                        A form of treatment for Type II Diabetes Mellitus are incretin mimetics. Incretin mimetics copy
                        the incretin effect of incretins such as Glucagon Like Peptide 1. This is the explanation for the
                        fact that oral uptake causes a bigger release of insulin, than the parenteral uptake.
                        Glucagon like peptide 1, produced in the L-cells of the intestine, is secreted upon nutrient
                        availability, and reaches the pancreas through the bloodstream. There it will bind its receptor
                        (a G-protein coupled receptor), which will activate Adenylate Cyclase (if ATP is available within
                        the cell), initiating the production of cAMP. Overall, this will lead to increased Calcium Ion
                        influx, allowing for more Insulin to be secreted from the beta cells. This increased secretion will help
                        overcome a relative lack of insulin in Type II Diabetes Mellitus, if the amount of incretins
                        secreted is sufficient.') }}

                          Despite of the successes, off-target activities can be observed in many cases.
                          These off-target activities lead to unwanted genome alterations when non-homologous end
