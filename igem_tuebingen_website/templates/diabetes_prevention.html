                            enough to adequately spread the notion of a balanced nutrition to prevent potentially fatal diseases,

                            a GMO or was produced by a GMO, is faced with a lot of, in our opinion unreasonable, stigma.
                            This is especially important, since due to the rising world population, at one point there
                            won’t be enough resources, if we completely rule out the use of GMO-based food.
